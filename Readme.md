Usage
-----

Using this image for the first time will start a download automatically.
Further runs will be immediate, as the image will be cached locally.

This image provides the Craft CMS application running on Apache / MySQL / PHP / Supervisor.

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name craft gabrielmoreira/craft
```

You can now point your webbrowser to this URL:

```
http://localhost/admin
```

This is a rather common setup following docker's conventions:

* `-d` will run a detached session running in the background
* `-p {OutsidePort}:80` will bind the webserver to the given outside port
* `--name` (Optional) the name of container instance
* `gabrielmoreira/craft` the name of this docker image
